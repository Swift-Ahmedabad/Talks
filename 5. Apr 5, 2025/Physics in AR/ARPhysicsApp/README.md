# AR Physics App

Drop and throw balls that bounce off real surfaces in your room! Use your phone's camera to scan your environment, then watch balls interact with walls, floors, and furniture.

## What You Need

- iPhone 12 Pro or newer (with LiDAR sensor)
- iPad Pro (2020 or later)

## How to Use

### Step 1: Scan Your Room

1. Open the app
2. Slowly move your phone around pointing at:
   - Floor
   - Walls
   - Furniture
3. You'll see a colorful mesh appear showing what's been scanned

**Tips:**
- Move slowly for best results
- Make sure the room has good lighting
- Get close to surfaces (about arm's length away)

### Step 2: Choose a Ball Type

Pick from 4 different materials at the bottom of the screen:

- 🟤 **Wood** - Medium weight, gentle bounce
- 🟡 **Plastic** - Light, bounces well
- 🔴 **Rubber** - Super bouncy!
- ⚫ **Metal** - Heavy, doesn't bounce much

### Step 3: Add Balls

Tap the **"Add Ball"** button to drop a ball in front of you.

### Step 4: Play!

- **Touch and drag** a ball to move it
- **Swipe fast** while holding to throw it
- Watch balls bounce off scanned surfaces

## Tips

✅ Scan the floor first so balls don't fall through
✅ Try different materials to see how they bounce differently
✅ Throw metal balls and rubber balls - see the difference!
✅ Scan furniture to create obstacles



Have fun experimenting with physics! 🎾
